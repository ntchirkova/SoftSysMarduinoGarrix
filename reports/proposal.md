## Project Goals
In this project we would like to make an Arduino Synthesizer. We will create a program that can generate a waveform that will correspond with a sound. In order to create these sounds the arduino will synthesize different waves of varying frequencies to make pleasing tones. These waveforms will include sine waves, triangle waves, and square waves. For our MVP we would just like to make a device that we can control what noises it outputs. The sound it outputs will be an arduino synthesised waveform. To take our project further we can create an interface that allows users to select waveforms, save generated waveforms, and then playback various saved “songs” like you would be able to play songs on an “iPod”. 
We are excited to be working with electrical hardware integrated application of C however the main goal of this project is software focused, not circuit focused. By implementing an already existing SoftSysSynth circuit we can hit the ground running with the embedded systems side of this project. 

## Initial Steps
In order to get started with this project, we need to obtain an Arduino and related hardware from Allen. The SofSysSynth circuit exists and we can use that to begin development. There are multiple online guides we have found that give us direction in how to develop the software. Here are our first few steps.

1. Find the circuit board and make sure it works as intended. Definition of Done:  When we run the test script wave2.ino and press a button we will hear a sawtooth tone. Both of us plan to work on this step.
2. Programmatically define different types of waves (sine, box, etc). Definition of Done: Have working function that takes a frequency and generates a waveform. We will split up the different types of waves equally between us.
3. Load these waves onto the Arduino and see if they work. Definition of Done: Selected waveform will output on speaker. We will both do this step.


## Learning Goals:

#### Nina: 
I would like to use this project to find an application for using C and through this learn more about C and its values. I am also excited to refresh my knowledge of circuits and Arduinos. 

#### Sam:
Through this project I am excited to learn C and do so in an embedded systems and hardware related application. I am interested in learning how to develop software that needs to integrate with hardware and understand the differences between embedded systems software and standalone software only applications. I am also going to use this project to improve my git practices and git hygiene.
